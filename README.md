# Problems

A collection of solutions to programming problems.

This is a collection of single-file programs that implement the solution to
a mathematical or programming problem.  These problems were mostly found on
the Internet as a result of searching for software engineering interview
questions.  Some are just demonstrations of language behavior or features.
